# BAE305_Aquaponics.Project


## Summary:

   The purpose of this project is to have an autonomous aquaponics system which includes an autonomous fish tank and plant growing enviroment. The two systems, the fish tank and the garden, work together by providing and filtering water for eachother. Each of these components is vital to keep a livable enviroment for the fish while also benefiting the plants.
